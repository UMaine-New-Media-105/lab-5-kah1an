Exercise 1--

Added my dachshund sprite function and then created an if statement in order to get the sprite to bounce off the walls in both the x and y direction. 
First I created variables for x, y, and speedX and speedY above the setup function. Then I initalised the variables, setting x and y to 0 and randomized 
speedX and speedY. Lastly, I created two if statements, one to have the sprite reverse it's speed if it hit the wall in the x direction and the other to 
have it reverse it's speed if it hit the wall in the y direction. I had to tweak around with my greater than and less than values here due to the irregular
shape of the sprite. https://editor.p5js.org/105-Kahlan/sketches/_bhmXZs1h
